# Algorithmic Insurance - Medical Malpractice Case: A User Guide

This codelab provides a step-by-step guide to using the "Algorithmic Insurance - Medical Malpractice Case" application. This application is designed to help you understand how algorithmic assistance can impact medical malpractice risk, particularly in breast cancer detection. It's inspired by the research in "Algorithmic Insurance" by Bertsimas and Orfanoudaki (2022). By exploring different scenarios and visualizing the results, you'll gain insights into the interplay between human expertise and AI in healthcare risk management. We will focus on the concepts and the application's functionality rather than diving into the code itself.

## Getting Started

**Duration: 00:05**

First, let's understand the core concepts behind the application. The app focuses on simulating and analyzing medical malpractice risk in the context of breast cancer detection, considering the integration of algorithmic assistance.

**Key Concepts Recap:**

*   **Binary Classification:** Identifying cases as either Benign or Malignant.
*   **Classification Threshold (τ):**  The cut-off point for classifying a case based on a model's output.
*   **Sensitivity (Recall):**  The model's ability to correctly identify Malignant cases.
*   **Specificity:**  The model's ability to correctly identify Benign cases.
*   **False Positive (FP):** Incorrectly classifying a Benign case as Malignant.
*   **False Negative (FN):** Incorrectly classifying a Malignant case as Benign.
*   **Value at Risk (VaR):** The maximum potential loss at a given confidence level.
*   **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR):**  The expected loss beyond the VaR.
*   **Algorithmic Assistance Level (θ):**  The degree to which AI assists in decision-making (0 = no AI, 1 = full AI).
*   **Expected Cost (E(C)):**  The estimated financial loss from malpractice claims.

Now, let's dive into the application's different sections. Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between them.

## Simulator

**Duration: 00:10**

The "Simulator" section allows you to simulate medical malpractice risk based on various input parameters.

1.  **Input Parameters:**
    *   **Number of Patients:** Enter the number of patients for the simulation.
    *   **Classification Threshold (τ):** Adjust the slider to change the classification threshold.  A lower threshold will classify more cases as Malignant, increasing sensitivity but potentially decreasing specificity.
    *   **Algorithmic Assistance Level (θ):**  Control the level of AI assistance.  A higher value means the decision-making relies more on the algorithm.
    *   **Mean Cost of False Positive (μ):** Specify the average cost associated with a false positive diagnosis.
    *   **Standard Deviation of False Positive Cost (σ\_μ):** Define the variability in the cost of false positives.
    *   **Mean Cost of False Negative (M):** Specify the average cost associated with a false negative diagnosis.  False negatives are generally much more costly in the context of medical malpractice.
    *   **Standard Deviation of False Negative Cost (σ\_M):** Define the variability in the cost of false negatives.

2.  **Results:**
    *   The application displays the calculated **Sensitivity**, **Specificity**, and **Expected Cost** based on your input parameters. Observe how these values change as you adjust the sliders and number inputs.

3.  **Visualization:**
    *   A bar chart visualizes the **Cost by Error Type**, showing the relative contributions of False Positives and False Negatives to the overall expected cost.

<aside class="positive">
Experiment with different values for the input parameters to understand their impact on the results. Notice how changing the classification threshold (τ) affects sensitivity and specificity, and consequently, the expected cost.

## Risk Analysis

**Duration: 00:15**

The "Risk Analysis" section focuses on analyzing Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) under different scenarios. VaR and CVaR are important metrics for understanding the potential financial risks associated with medical malpractice.

1.  **Input Parameters:**
    *   **Number of Patients:**  Same as in the Simulator section.
    *   **Mean Cost of False Positive (μ):**  Same as in the Simulator section.
    *   **Standard Deviation of False Positive Cost (σ\_μ):** Same as in the Simulator section.
    *   **Mean Cost of False Negative (M):** Same as in the Simulator section.
    *   **Standard Deviation of False Negative Cost (σ\_M):** Same as in the Simulator section.
    *   **Confidence Level:** This determines the confidence level for VaR and CVaR calculations. A higher confidence level (e.g., 99%) represents a more conservative estimate of potential losses.
    *   **Theta Range:**  Specify a range of Algorithmic Assistance Levels (θ) to analyze. The application will calculate VaR and CVaR for a series of theta values within this range.

2.  **Risk Analysis Results:**
    *   The application displays two key visualizations:
        *   **Expected Cost vs. Algorithmic Assistance Level (θ):** This line chart shows how the expected cost changes as you vary the level of algorithmic assistance.
        *   **VaR and CVaR at \[Confidence Level] vs. Algorithmic Assistance Level (θ):**  This line chart shows how VaR and CVaR change as you vary the level of algorithmic assistance.  It allows you to understand how algorithmic assistance affects the tail risk (i.e., the risk of extreme losses).

<aside class="negative">
Pay close attention to the impact of the Theta Range slider. You can observe how different levels of algorithmic assistance can significantly affect the VaR and CVaR, indicating the potential for both risk reduction and risk amplification depending on the scenario.

## Interpretability Impact

**Duration: 00:10**

The "Interpretability Impact" section explores how the *interpretability* of AI models can influence risk exposure. Interpretability refers to the degree to which humans can understand the reasons behind a model's decisions. The impact is modeled using different curves that represent the contractual risk exposure as a function of the algorithmic assistance level (θ).

1.  **Input Parameters:**
    *   **Cost of Human Decision (c\_h):** Specify the cost associated with a decision made purely by a human.
    *   **Cost of ML Decision (c\_ml):** Specify the cost associated with a decision made purely by a machine learning model.
    *   **Curve Type:** Select the type of curve to model the relationship between algorithmic assistance and contractual risk exposure. Options include "Linear", "Concave", and "Convex".

2.  **Visualization:**
    *   A line chart displays the **Contractual Risk Exposure vs. Algorithmic Assistance Level (θ)** for the selected curve type. This visualization helps you understand how different levels of algorithmic assistance, combined with the interpretability of the model, affect the overall risk exposure.

<aside class="positive">
Experiment with the different curve types (Linear, Concave, Convex) and observe how they change the relationship between algorithmic assistance and risk exposure. This highlights the importance of considering the impact of interpretability on overall risk management.

By completing these steps, you should now have a good understanding of how to use the Algorithmic Insurance - Medical Malpractice Case application. Remember that this is a simulation for educational purposes, and the results should be interpreted in that context.
